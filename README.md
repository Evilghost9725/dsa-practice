# DSA Practice

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice files.  
I'm organizing my learning topic-wise to stay consistent and review problem-solving patterns.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search

## Format

Each folder contains `.cpp` solutions to related problems.  
I'm adding minimal comments or links to original problems wherever possible.

## Goal

- Build consistency
- Track my growth
- Revise anytime before interviews or contests
